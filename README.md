# First Person Character Controller

A simple first person character controller asset for Unity 3D.



## Overview

This asset is designed as a basic skeleton for a more complex controller system. It includes features such as:

- Customizable Walking and Jumping speeds
- Camera Control: Defaults to 90 degree vertical camera movement, but can be customized.
- Collision Detection: Detects collisions between player and objects with rigidbodies.
- Ground Detection: Defineable ground layer  for customizable jump surfaces.


## How to Use

    1. Import the ControllerPackage package into the Unity project.
    2. Create a "Ground" layer and assign the layer to "Ground_mask" in the asset.
    3. Assign any surfaces as ground to allow for ground detection and jumping.

    
## Disclaimer

This project is still in early development, with many features still planned. Lots of improvements are still needing to be made, so some systems may not work as expected.
